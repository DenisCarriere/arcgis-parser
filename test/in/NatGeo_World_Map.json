The map was developed by National Geographic and Esri and reflects the distinctive National Geographic cartographic style in a multi-scale reference map of the world. The map was authored using data from a variety of leading data providers, including DeLorme, HERE, UNEP-WCMC, NASA, ESA, USGS, and others. This reference map includes administrative boundaries, cities, protected areas, highways, roads, railways, water features, buildings and landmarks, overlaid on shaded relief and land cover imagery for added context. The map currently includes global coverage down to ~1:144k scale and more detailed coverage for North America down to ~1:9k scale.
