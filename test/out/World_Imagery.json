The map includes 15m TerraColor imagery at small and mid-scales (591M down to 72k) and 2.5m SPOT Imagery (288k to 72k) for the world, and USGS 15m Landsat imagery for Antarctica. The map features 0.3m resolution imagery in the continental United States and 0.6m resolution imagery in parts of Western Europe from Digital Globe. Recent 1m USDA NAIP imagery is available in select states of the US. In other parts of the world, 1 meter resolution imagery is available from GeoEye IKONOS, AeroGRID, and IGN Spain. Additionally, imagery at different resolutions has been contributed by the GIS User Community.
